# Cloud Services
​
Decide whether the following AWS services are Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), Software as a service (SaaS), or Serverless and give your reasoning.
​
EC2 - IaaS - rent a server(computer)
​
S3 - IaaS - provides scalable storage for objects (files, images, videos, and backups.)
S3 offers a pay-as-you-go model, enabling users to only pay for the storage they use.  
​
RDS - PaaS / DBaaS - Relational Database Service, managed database instances in the cloud, relieving users from many of the administrative tasks associated with traditional database management
​
Lambda - PaaS / Faas - Lambda runs and automatically manages your backend code. Paas offers more control over application development
​
EKS - PaaS - managed and supported Kubernetes service for development (another platform)
​
DynamoDB - SaaS / DBaaS - fully managed NOSQL database server offering high functionality / no development required.
