# Scaling
​
Horizontal Scaling:
​
    Pro
        Cost: This type of scaling can be cheap on demand for short periods of time.
​
    Con
        Data Synchronisation; When dealing with this kind of scaling, it might be difficult to have consistent data across all instances to provide a consistent user experience.
​
Vertical Scaling
​
    Pros
        Simplicity: Easier to implement compared to horizontal scaling (no need to manage scaling an individual computer). 
​
    Cons
        Limited scalability due to cost
​
## Scenario
​
An e-commerce website experiences a sudden surge in traffic due to a flash sale event. The website needs to handle the increased load efficiently to ensure smooth user experience and prevent downtime.

The smartest scaling approach would be elastic scaling due to being able to handle the demand required as well as being to scale up and down to ensure cost effectiveness.
